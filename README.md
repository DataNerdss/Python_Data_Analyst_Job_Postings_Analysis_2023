## Insights

San Francisco, CA:

It offers the highest average salary at $115,000.
However, it has a relatively low count of jobs (75), indicating high-paying roles in a competitive market.
New York, NY:

It has one of the highest job counts (327) but a moderate salary of $94,068.5.
This shows that while New York has many opportunities, the salaries may not be as high as in some other cities like San Francisco.
Tampa, FL:

Tampa has a high average salary of $98,900 and a relatively high count of 97 jobs, indicating a strong market for Data Analysts.
Los Angeles, CA:

Los Angeles also has both a high job count (97) and a competitive salary of $96,500.
Washington, DC:

Washington has a higher job count (107) and offers a high salary of $95,000, making it a strong job market both in terms of opportunities and compensation.
Anywhere (Remote):

Remote roles have the highest job count (568), but the average salary of $87,500 is lower compared to most in-office positions.
Chicago, IL:

Chicago has a decent job count of 130 and an average salary of $91,250, making it one of the larger markets, but with a lower salary compared to the top-paying cities.
Conclusion:
San Francisco, Tampa, and Washington, DC stand out for having both high salaries and decent job counts.
New York offers many opportunities but with slightly lower pay.
Remote jobs offer a large number of positions, but with lower average salaries compared to in-office roles in major cities.
This overlap shows that while some locations offer both a high number of job opportunities and competitive salaries, others may have a trade-off between salary and job availability.
